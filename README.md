# perScholas2020

Per Scholas was my first coding boot camp. The program was overwhelming at time because of the three month period, but it was a great experience. I am currently working on scripts using LUA, because I would like to run/maintain a FiveM server in the near future. I plan on polishing some of these projects in the near future!
